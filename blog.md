## First post!

*27 May 2014*

That’s right, this is the first ever post on this blog! (If you could call it that… All it really is is a way of putting information in one place so that I feel like it’s not going to be lost forever in my mind…) I’ve decided to manually create a script to generate this web page because I couldn’t be bothered going through all the hassle (or lack thereof) of using a static site generator and so decided to go to the effort of making my own.

Funny how the (my?) brain works sometimes, isn’t it?
